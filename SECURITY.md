# Security Measures for Fur Finance

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to prevent spam, SQL injection, and other malicious activities.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Input Validation

#### Pet Names
- **Length**: 2-50 characters
- **Characters**: Only letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes
- **Blocked**: SQL injection attempts (;, --, /*)
- **Validation**: Real-time client-side validation

#### Pet Breeds
- **Length**: Up to 100 characters
- **Characters**: Only letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes
- **Optional**: Can be left empty

#### Birth Dates
- **Range**: Within last 30 years and not in the future
- **Validation**: Prevents impossible dates like 1899 or future dates

#### Expense Descriptions
- **Length**: Up to 200 characters
- **Characters**: Letters, numbers, spaces, basic punctuation
- **Blocked**: Special characters that could be used for injection

#### Expense Amounts
- **Range**: $0.01 to $999,999.99
- **Prevents**: Unrealistic amounts

### 2. Rate Limiting

#### Pet Creation
- **Limit**: 3 pets per minute per user
- **Reset**: 60-second window
- **Message**: Clear error with countdown timer

#### Expense Creation
- **Limit**: 10 expenses per minute per user
- **Reset**: 60-second window
- **Message**: Clear error with countdown timer

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention

#### Client-Side
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Character Filtering**: Blocks dangerous characters
- **Type Validation**: Ensures proper data types

#### Server-Side (Supabase)
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameters
- **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security prevents unauthorized access
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation as backup

## Database Cleanup

### Spam Detection Rules
1. **SQL Injection Attempts**: Names containing `;`, `--`, `/*`
2. **Inappropriate Content**: Profanity and offensive terms
3. **Random Characters**: Very short, random names (3 chars or less)
4. **Impossible Dates**: Birth dates before 1990 or in the future
5. **Gibberish**: Non-sensical names that don't match real pet names

### Cleanup Script
Run `cleanup-spam-data.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to remove obvious spam.

## Monitoring

### What to Watch For
- **Rapid Submissions**: Multiple pets/expenses created quickly
- **Suspicious Names**: Random characters, SQL injection attempts
- **Unusual Patterns**: Same user creating many entries
- **Invalid Data**: Impossible dates, unrealistic amounts

### Response Actions
1. **Immediate**: Rate limiting prevents most spam
2. **Manual**: Review and delete suspicious entries
3. **Automated**: Consider additional filtering rules

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **CAPTCHA**: For suspicious activity patterns
- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: More sophisticated than user-based
- **Machine Learning**: Detect patterns in spam vs legitimate data
- **Admin Dashboard**: Easy interface to review and manage data
- **Automated Cleanup**: Scheduled jobs to remove obvious spam

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Use realistic pet names and information
- Don't test the system with fake data
- Report any suspicious activity

### For Developers
- Regularly review the database for spam
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
- Update validation rules as needed
- Keep security measures up to date
